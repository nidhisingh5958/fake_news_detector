# Fake News Detector

A machine learning project to detect false news and reporting utilising Natural Language Processing (NLP). The model utilizes several machine learning algorithms to classify news articles as real or fake based on the content of the articles. 

<h2> Capabilities of the Project: </h2>

- The ability to classify text for fake news detection. 
- The ability to use NLP capabilities (for example: word frequency, sentiment analysis, & etc.).
- Trained on popular fake news datasets- e.g. Kaggle Fake News Dataset.
- Supports machine learning models: logistic regression, naive bayes, SVM, and neural networks. 
- Evaluation based on accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score. 

<h2> Tech Stack: </h2>

- <h3>Language</h3>- Python
- <h3>Libraries</h3>- Scikit-learn, TensorFlow/Keras, NLTK, SpaCy, Pandas, NumPy
- <h3>Tools</h3> - Jupyter Notebooks.
